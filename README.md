Eye tracking in computer vision refers to the process of detecting and measuring the movement of the eyes and/or gaze direction of a person using a camera or specialized eye-tracking hardware. This paper introduces a novel eye tracking algorithm to improve accuracy from current methods. Accuracy is measured in centimeters by the absolute difference between the distance of the estimated and actual gaze position on a tablet screen. The multistage pipeline consists of first preprocessing data to extract features (facial/eye regions) relevant to direction of gaze from the images, and then training the CNN-based model on those features. We experiment with removing features through an ablation study, adding an eye grid feature, concatenating the two eye features, and changing the learning rate and batch size. 
Leveraging multiple fully connected convolutional neural networks and max pooling layers on left eye, right eye, face, and face mask features, our project found that the best model was with a batch size of 128, learning rate of 0.0001, and no eye features, resulting in a test error of 1.6385. While concatenating the left and right eye features and adding an eye grid feature did not seem to have a significant effect on the accuracy, excluding the eye features all together improved the validation error.
